# Conversation-Parser

A website primarily for allowing a user to upload their Skype or WhatsApp export data, and converting
this into a format that is easily exportable and readable, mostly for evidence for UKVI immigration application
evidence, as scrolling through potentially years of data is perhaps not the most enjoyable of experiences
