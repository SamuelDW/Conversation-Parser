        <p>Dear Visa Officer,</p>

        <p>The UKVI Immigration Evidence Team can verify that the data you see before you
            was not created for the <br>sole purpose of this letter, and that we hold no relation
            with the person submitting this document. The data seen was generated from a JSON File
            which the user will have downloaded from Skype Export History, Facebook export chats,
            or WhatsApp export chat feature.
        </p>
        <p>We hope that this document will aid you in deciding the outcome of this visa application,
            and aids in showing sufficient evidence that the relationship is genuine and subsisting.
        </p>
